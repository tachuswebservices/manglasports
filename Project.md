### Key Architectural Patterns

#### Component Architecture
- **Atomic Design Principles**: Components organized by complexity (atoms, molecules, organisms)
- **Container/Component Pattern**: Separation of logic and presentation
- **Composition Over Inheritance**: Flexible component composition
- **Centralized Data Management**: Consistent product data source to ensure pricing consistency across pages

#### State Management
- **Context API**: For global theme and UI state
- **Local State**: For component-specific state
- **URL State**: For filter and search parameters

#### Performance
- **Code Splitting**: Route-based code splitting
- **Lazy Loading**: For non-critical components
- **Image Optimization**: Responsive images with modern formats

#### Best Practices
- **Type Safety**: Comprehensive TypeScript integration with strict typing
- **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance with keyboard navigation and ARIA labels
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with Tailwind CSS
- **Performance**: Optimized bundle size, code splitting, and lazy loading
- **State Management**: React Query for server state and React Context for UI state
- **Routing**: Nested routes with React Router v6
- **Animations**: Smooth transitions with Framer Motion
- **Theming**: Dark/light mode with system preference detection
- **Form Handling**: Form validation with React Hook Form
- **Error Boundaries**: Graceful error handling and fallback UIs

### State Management
- **Local Component State**: useState for component-specific state
- **Global Theme State**: Context API for theme preferences
- **Query State**: React Query for data fetching (prepared for future implementation)
- **Centralized Product Data**: Single source of truth for product information to maintain consistency
